# Documentation

Julia package's documentation is usually made by [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl). It looks like readthedocs but is implemented in pure Julia, therefore you won't need to install extra dependencies.

simply type the following command in your terminal to build the documentation locally.

```s
shell> julia make.jl local
```
